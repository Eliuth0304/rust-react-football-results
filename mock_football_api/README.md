# Football Results Mock API

This project is a mock server imitating the backing API used for football results. It is intended to be used while developing, in order to not exhaust the limited number of API calls available from the real service. It returns a snapshot in time of the Premier League as it was on the 12th May 2022. The JSON it returns is structured identically to that of the real, rate limited API.
